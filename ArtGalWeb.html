        <h1>Selling, Commissions, and Bidding</h1>
        <p><strong>ArtHUB</strong> · <time datetime="2025-08-27">CREATE YOUR WORLD!</time></p>

        <p>
          In today’s creative world, artists have many opportunities to share their work beyond simple exhibitions.  
          Selling artworks allows creators to earn directly from their passion, whether through physical galleries or online platforms.  
          By offering their creations for sale, artists not only gain income but also connect with people who truly appreciate their work.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Commissions open another exciting door for artists.  
          Clients can request personalized pieces that capture unique ideas, stories, or emotions.  
          Accepting commissions gives artists the chance to grow, adapt to different challenges, and expand their portfolio with meaningful projects.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Art bidding, on the other hand, provides a dynamic way of valuing creativity.  
          Through auctions, artworks can find their highest worth as collectors and art lovers place bids.  
          This not only rewards the artist but also highlights the true demand and appreciation for their craft.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether selling, accepting commissions, or participating in art bidding, each step helps artists build sustainable careers and strengthen the community of creatives who inspire one another.

          <img src="char.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Charcoal Drawing</h3>
            <p>Charcoal drawing is one of the most expressive and versatile forms of art. It allows artists to create deep shadows, bold lines, and soft shading with ease. By using different types of charcoal such as vine or compressed sticks, you can experiment with textures and tones that bring a drawing to life.</p>
            <p>To start, lightly sketch your outline with a pencil before applying charcoal. Smudging with fingers or blending stumps helps in achieving gradients and realistic effects. Erasers also play a vital role in creating highlights and refining details within the piece.</p>
            <p>Mastering charcoal requires patience and control, but it is an excellent medium for capturing emotions, portraits, and dramatic compositions. It is often chosen by beginners and professionals alike for its ability to produce striking contrasts and quick results.</p>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="colo.jpg" alt="Color Pencil Drawing" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Color Pencil Drawing</h3>
            <p>Color pencil art is widely appreciated for its vibrant tones and precision. With layering techniques, artists can achieve realistic shading, smooth gradients, and detailed textures. High-quality colored pencils allow for richer pigmentation and blending.</p>
            <p>To begin, start with light layers of color and gradually build them up. Pressing harder with the pencil produces darker tones, while lighter strokes add subtlety. Blending tools or even tissue paper can be used to merge colors seamlessly.</p>
            <p>This medium is ideal for beginners because it is clean, portable, and easy to control. Whether used for portraits, landscapes, or imaginative works, colored pencils offer endless possibilities for creative expression.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="paint.jpg" alt="Painting Example" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Painting (Oil / Acrylic / Watercolor)</h3>
            <p>Painting is one of the oldest and most dynamic forms of art, ranging from classical oil paintings to modern acrylics and watercolors. Each medium offers unique qualities—oils provide depth and blending time, acrylics dry quickly and allow layering, while watercolors create soft and translucent effects.</p>
            <p>The process usually begins with preparing a canvas or paper and sketching a light outline. Artists then apply layers of paint using brushes, palette knives, or even unconventional tools to achieve their desired textures and styles.</p>
            <p>Painting encourages experimentation and creativity, making it an essential practice for both beginners and experienced artists. It is a timeless way to express ideas, emotions, and beauty through vibrant colors and brushstrokes.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="grap.jpg" alt="Graphite Drawing" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Graphite Drawing</h3>
            <p>Graphite drawing is a classic and widely practiced art form, often associated with sketching and detailed studies. It is flexible, allowing artists to create fine lines, soft shading, and intricate textures using pencils of varying hardness.</p>
            <p>To start, select the right grade of graphite pencil—softer pencils (B) are darker and great for shading, while harder pencils (H) are lighter and useful for fine details. Blending stumps or tissues help smooth out the shading for realistic effects.</p>
            <p>This medium is beginner-friendly yet sophisticated enough for advanced artworks. Graphite drawing is perfect for practice, learning proportions, and developing precision, making it a foundation for many aspiring artists.</p>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="point.jpg" alt="Pointillism" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Pointillism</h3>
            <p>Pointillism is a painting technique that uses tiny dots of color placed closely together to form an image. When viewed from a distance, the dots blend visually to create vibrant scenes.</p>
            <p>This technique, pioneered by Georges Seurat, emphasizes precision and patience. Artists use small brushstrokes or pen points to build texture, color depth, and light.</p>
            <p>It is a rewarding style that teaches patience and a deeper understanding of color theory and optical mixing.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="imp.jpg" alt="Impressionism" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Impressionism</h3>
            <p>Impressionism focuses on capturing the fleeting effects of light and color in a scene rather than precise detail. Artists use loose brushwork and vibrant palettes.</p>
            <p>It emerged in 19th-century France and revolutionized art by emphasizing mood and atmosphere over realism.</p>
            <p>This style is perfect for experimenting with lighting, seasons, and spontaneous outdoor painting.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="abs.jpg" alt="Abstract Art" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Abstract Art</h3>
            <p>Abstract art breaks away from realistic representation and uses shapes, colors, and forms to express emotions or ideas.</p>
            <p>It allows complete creative freedom and encourages viewers to interpret the artwork in their own way.</p>
            <p>This style is ideal for exploring pure expression and emotion without the constraints of realism.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="cub.jpg" alt="Cubism" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Cubism</h3>
            <p>Cubism deconstructs subjects into geometric shapes and reassembles them in abstract compositions.</p>
            <p>Founded by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, it emphasizes multiple perspectives in one artwork.</p>
            <p>This approach challenges traditional viewpoints and inspires innovative thinking.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="art-item">
          <img src="sur.jpg" alt="Surrealism" />
          <div class="art-description">
            <h3>Surrealism</h3>
            <p>Surrealism blends dreamlike imagery with reality, often producing strange or fantastical scenes.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the subconscious, it allows artists to express thoughts beyond rational understanding.</p>
            <p>It’s ideal for storytelling and imaginative concept exploration.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

            <h3>Digital Art</h3>
            <p>Digital art uses software and digital tools to create illustrations, paintings, and designs.</p>
            <p>It offers limitless possibilities for editing, layering, and experimentation.</p>

      <h2>About Myself as an Artist</h2>
      <p>I started drawing seriously in 2022. At first, it was just a hobby to pass the time, but as the months went by, I realized that art was more than that—it became a part of my life and identity. The first sketches I made were simple, but they motivated me to keep going and improve every day.</p>
      <p>My inspiration comes from my co-artists. Watching their works and learning from their techniques gave me the courage to explore my own creativity. Their passion and dedication to art pushed me to try new styles and express myself without fear of making mistakes.</p>
      <p>Through art, I found not only happiness but also opportunities. With my artworks, I have been able to earn money, and with that, I can buy the things I want. Art has given me freedom and confidence, and it continues to shape the way I live my life today.</p>
